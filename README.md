# SimpleImageTransformer

Project that I made for my class of Digital Image Processing.
The application implements a serie of image processing algorithms, according to the class exercises.

To use, just load a image using the input element at the start.
Then, just open one of the exercises in the sidebar, selecting the operation to run.
